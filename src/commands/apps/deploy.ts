 * Handles the "apps deploy" command.

 * TODO: This is a placeholder for v0. The actual deployment mechanism needs to be defined.
 *
 * Deployment could involve:
 * - Uploading code/assets to Whop's hosting infrastructure
 * - Creating a new app version/release
 * - Triggering a build pipeline
 * - Updating app configuration
 *
 * Once the deployment API/process is clarified, this command should:
 * 1. Validate the appId exists and user has access
 * 2. Package/prepare the app for deployment
 * 3. Upload or trigger the deployment
 * 4. Poll for deployment status
 * 5. Report success/failure with logs
 *
 * @param appId The ID of the app to deploy
